# Uncommon HTML Tag Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML: using unsupported or incorrectly used custom elements.  The error is not necessarily a syntax error, but rather a semantic error that may not always be explicitly flagged by the browser's developer tools.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when attempting to use an HTML tag that either doesn't exist or isn't properly defined within the context of the document.  Browsers handle these situations differently; they might ignore the tag completely, display a blank space, or even throw a warning in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all HTML tags used are supported by the target browser(s) and that custom elements, if used, are properly defined using techniques like custom elements (web components).
